## Introduction

React Native allows you to create native apps for Android and iOS using React. This guide covers basic components and concepts necessary for building a React Native application.

## Components

### View

The `View` component is a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls.

```jsx
import { View } from "react-native";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
    {/* Other components go here */}
  </View>
);
```
